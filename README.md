Welcome to our cozy, dungeon adventure game!

## Halfway project review:

### Name of game: Cat Adventure

### Names of group members: 
* Talia Goody
* Estephanie Fernandez
* Nuonnettra Kanzaki
* Alisa Sriphet

### Description of current target for the game - final target :

It will an avatar based game where the player plays as a cat while the camera watches slightly behind it in a 3rd person view. The player will navigate through a map in order to collect 2 keys. After collecting both, they will be able to open a chest hidden in the maze and get their yarn (Victory situation). As the cat moves, it will use up stamina which can only be refilled through completion of a typing minigame also located in the maze. 

The maze will have 4 main rooms:
1. Goal room - the room with the yarn chest
2. Sliding puzzle room - with have a puzzle 
3. Stamina replenish room - will have a typing minigame presented as a pond. Upon victory, the player will receive a fish that restores their stamina by a fixed amount if won. If they lose, they'll get bones that reduces their stamina more
4. Initial room - this is where the player spawns. It will have a tiny version of the stamina mini game, and an item for the player to slide
